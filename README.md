# iosChemistryCalculator
A small application to calculate answers to various chemistry problems! It can solve for molar mass of compounds, perform different stoichiometry calculations, can calculate wavelength, frequency, wave number, and Balmer-Rydberg calculations, with plenty more to come! If you want a certain calculation that is not there, create an issue on the GitHub page, and I will do my best to add it! The link is on the "About" button on the bottom of the home page.
