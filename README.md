A small application to calculate answers to various chemistry problems! It can solve for molar mass of compounds, perform different stoichiometry calculations, can calculate wavelength, frequency, wave number, Balmer-Rydberg, and De Broglie calculations, with plenty more to come! If you want a certain calculation that is not there, create an issue on the GitHub page, and I will do my best to add it! The link is on the "About" button on the bottom of the home page.

Constant values are from the NIST: https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/index.html.
